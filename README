# How to push .jl file to git repository
1. Download GitHub Desktop, log in and clone this repository to your computer
2. After you make your code in jupyter notebook save your file as "Executable Script" (.jl) (But you can also leave it as ipynb jupyter notebook and push to git the notebook)
3. Then open the terminal and write "cd" + the path to your repository on the computer "C:\..."
4. Check the status using "git status" command
5. Write "git add "Name of the file.jl""
6. "git commit -m "Message you want to provide(what you have changed in the code)""
7. "git push origin main"
8. Check the git if it has been uploaded

That way we can see the changes made by other people and do not lose in different versions of the code.
